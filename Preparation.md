### Preparation ###

1. In a large pot, brown the bacon over medium heat

3. While the meat is browning, add diced onion and stir until onion is translucent
4. Add the garlic and be careful not to burn it
5. Add the paprika, cumin, and chili powder and stir.  The heat of the pan will release more of the flavor
6. Add all peppers and stir well
7. Add the beer and simmer until it is reduced by 1/3rd
8. Reduce heat, stir well and simmer for about 10 minutes so the meat can absorb some of the spice flavor
9. Add, tomatoes, carrot, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce
10. Simmer, partially covered over low heat, stirring occasionally for about 2 hours
11. Add black beans, corn, and continue over low heat for 1 hour.  Adding the beans later will keep them from breaking down 
11. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper
12. Top with shredded cheddar cheese, cilantro, and/or sour cream
